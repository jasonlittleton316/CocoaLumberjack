### Issue Description and Steps

Please fill in the detailed description of the issue (full textual output of any stack trace, compiler error, ...) and the steps to reproduce the issue.

Are you reporting a queue deadlock? If so, you must include a complete backtrace of all threads, which you can generate by typing `bt all` in the debugger after you hit the deadlock. Failure to do so will prevent us from helping you.
